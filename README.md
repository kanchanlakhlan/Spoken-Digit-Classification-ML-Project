# Spoken-Digit-Classification-ML-Project

The goal of this project is to implement, describe and present (multi-class)
classification models of choice for the recognition of spoken digits. More precisely,
the goal is to implement (multi-class) classifiers that take an audio file encoded into an
image of size 30Ã—30 of a spoken digit from zero to nine as their input and automatically
determine digit most likely has been spoken. The dataset to be used is the so-called Audio
MNIST dataset. Link is provided in description.

I did not use python builtin libraries (such as SciPy/SciKit-learn/Keras/PyTorch) to implement 
multiclass classifiaction algorithms but rather implemented Multinomial logistic regression 
classification and multinomial lasso logistic regression classification algorithms from scratch.
